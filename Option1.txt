Aspects Of Submission That Could Be Improved:

 Your program does not run as expected, 
 You need to to make small changes in your program in order for it to run, This is because of 
 variable mentioned in line 75 and variable in line 79: 
 when initialising a variable you should use names that are easy to rembember.eg
 Name = "JOHN"
